# Read Me Generator
  
### Description: 
When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, etc. 
Thus, I created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.
This generator stands out from others because it allows for the user to include a screenshot of their app or project.

### Table of Contents:
  - [Description](#description)
  - [Installation](#installation)
  - [Usage](#usage)
  - [Screenshot](#screenshot)
  - [Contributing](#contributing)
  - [Questions](#questions)
  - [License](#license)

### Installation:
The application will be invoked by using "node index.js"

### Usage:
You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.
